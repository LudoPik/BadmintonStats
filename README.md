# BadmintonStats
This is an exploration of professional badminton singles statistics.

## ShuttleSet Data
The data is called ShuttleSet and it is a very rich dataset containing information on a shot by shot basis. The data was collected manually by watching videos and taking down information about what is happening on the court. It contains useful information like: stroke type, hit location, landing location, player location, forehand vs backhand, etc.

## Aim
I hope to gain some new useful knowledge about professional badminton players to allow for new insights about the style of badminton that is played at a professional level.
